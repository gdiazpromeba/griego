	SHIPPING
</span>
<p style="font-weight: normal; font-size:12px; color:black">
	All of our products are shipped via UPS or USPS.
	<br/>
	UPS is a guaranteed delivery with tracking numbers, while USPS Priority and Express Mail doesn't use tracking numbers therefore delivery can not be guaranteed.
	<br/>
	UPS may cost a couple of dollars more but you get that extra guarantee, which we recommend during critical shipping periods such as holiday seasons, birthdays or any other special occasions. This recommendation comes from our past experience with both
	shipping methods.
	<br/>
	We do ship outside the Continental United States, but keep in mind that the shipping time is much longer and we reserve the right to refuse orders from certain countries. You will receive a notice via email once your order has been submitted along with
	the tracking information, if you choose USP shipping methods. You should receive your order in 7 to 10 business days (holidays excluded).
	<br />
