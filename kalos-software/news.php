	 				<strong>Usability</strong>
	 				<strong>Internal programming</strong>
	 				<ul>
	 				  <li>We made numerous internal changes, based on improved Java technology</li>
	 				  <li>They result in a faster, smoother user experience</li>
	 				  <li>You will also notice that the program displays charts faster, and finds more forms in the Greek morphological analysis more quickly</li>
	 				</ul>	 				
	 				
	 				<ul>
	 				  <li>A new section at the top is available, with the last selected form</li>
	 				  <li>This form determines what kind of charts are shown in the chart section</li>

 			<h3>Version 4.13 released</h3>
 			<h4><strong>1.Nov.2011</strong></h4>
 			<p class="bottom">
 				<strong>Added data</strong>
 				<ul>
                            <li>All remaining words from Strong's concordance that Kal&oacute;s was still unable to find in the Morphological Analysis have been added. This is good news for NT users!</li>
                            <li>We added the following parts of speech to both the dictionary and the morphological analysis:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Interjections</li>
                              <li>Indefinite pronouns</li>
                            </ul>
                            ... and added the ability to look for them in the Morphological analysis, and to produce printable charts for them.
                          </li>
                          <li>The way in which the middle and passive voice meanings are shown, has been standardized all across the dictionary. </li>
                          <li>Several extra substantives, adjectives, conjunctions, verbs and adverbs have been added. Some duplicate forms have been removed from the dictionary</li>
 				</ul>

 				<strong>Charts and listings</strong>
 				<ul>
 				  <li>Now there are charts available for <i>every</i> part of speech.</li>
 				  <li>Additional inflection charts can be invoked from either the "dictionary" or the "Morpholgical analysis" search screens.</li>
 				  <li>An additional tab with hard, very common forms (pronouns, articles, conjunctions, etc) is given.</li>
 				  <li>The printable inflection listings' look and feel has been improved and made consistent across listings.</li>
 				</ul>

 				<strong>Usability improvements</strong>
 				<ul>
 				  <li>Now, the letter size of the input boxes can also be changed</li>
 				  <li>Word type (part of speech) selectors now have a Check all/uncheck all option</li>
 				  <li>When a word "explodes" in too many forms, a secondary window appears, offering more feedback and flexibility on what to explode.</li>
                        </ul>

 				<strong>Errors corrected</strong>
 				<ul>
 				  <li>The accent placement of some middle participle forms (such as &#956;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;&#953;) has been corrected on both the inflection charts and the Morphological Analysis</li>
				  <li>The subjunctive aorist of &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8051;&#969; has been corrected.</li>
                          <li>Some verbs compound with preposition, having or not irregularities of their own (&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#961;&#961;&#8053;&#947;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;, &#954;&#8049;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#953;) produced inconsistent results in the Morphological Analysis. This (we hope) has been corrected</li>
                          <li>Adjectives related to feet ending in (--&#960;&#959;&#965;&#962;) are now inflected correctly (genitive in -&#960;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962;, etc.)</li>
                          <li>Irregular forms containing dieresis (for example, &#960;&#961;&#945;&#8163;&#962;) where ignored by the Morphological Analysis. Not anymore</li>
                          <li>In compound verbs, forms with the quantity of the preposition incorrectly specified (say, &#7936;&#957;<font color="red">&#945;</font> &#961;&#961;&#8055;&#960;&#964;&#969;) were incorrectly validated by the Morphological Analysis. Not anymore</li>
				  <li>On the word input boxes in Greek mode, accute and grave accents now can be overwritten and are visible on vowels that already had superscript makrons</li>
 				</ul>

 				  <li>added dieresis to compound verbs that do not contract the preposition (&#x03c0;&#x03b5;&#x03c1;&#x03b9;&#x03b9;&#x0308;&#x0301;&#x03c3;&#x03c4;&#x03b7;&#x03bc;&#x03b9;) </li>

 				  <li>verbs starting with triple consonant had sometimes problems with the augment.</li>
 				  <li>many "pluralized" substantives weren't marked as such, creating probems in bith the inflection and the MA.</li>
 				  <li>some verbs with irregular lack of augment in the aorist presented nevertheless an augment in the middle voice.</li>
 				  <li>the vocative for adjectives of "pluralized" form wasn't found by the MA</li>
 				  <li>any form selected having the particularity "Contracted" caused the program to fail</li>
 				  <li>invariable adjectives (numerals, etc) weren't found by the MA.</li>

 				</ul>
 				<strong>Usability improvements</strong>
 				<ul>
 				  <li>a detail panel has been added to the dictionary and morphological analysis grids.</li>
 				  <li>he final sigma is assumed and automatically corrected when possible.</li>
 				  <li>the "font size selector" also affects the detail section</li>
 				  <li>the default "substring location" is not "beggining" any longer, but "exact". </li>
 				  <li>the help content was updated, and it is the same as the online content</li>

 			<h3>Version 4.0.5 released</h3>
 			<h4><strong>7.Dec.2006</strong></h4>
 			<p class="bottom">
 				<strong>Usability improvements</strong>
 				<ul>
 				  <li>Each of the three sections of the program is clearly differentiated, with its own tab and input box.</li>
 				  <li>We removed the auto-search feature and added a Search button on each section, making clearer for the user what to do.</li>
 				  <li>We added cool independent sliders on each section, allowing the user to set the font size independently.</li>
 				  <li>We dramatically increased startup speed, and halved the speed at which the charts are generated. Furthermore, on the Morphological Analysis, basic search patterns are cached on the first search, so that each subsequent search is a little faster!.</li>
 				  <li>The typography (Font)  to be used for rendering Greek characters is the system's default (Tahoma for Windows, Geneva for Macintosh). This allows for a more natural look-and-fill, especially when changing the font size.</li>
 				  <li>We added a menu and a <span style="font-weight: bold">help</span>. Just go to help/contents.</li>
 				  <li>A menu bar and a help system were added.</li>
 				  <li>On the Chart generation section, caption was added, indicating what canonical form is being selected at the time.</li>
 				  <li>When generating verbals' charts, we corrected an error that caused the chart generated to be for the before-the-last form, not the last one.</li>
 				</ul>
 				<strong>Forms database additions</strong>
 				<ul>
 				  <li>When inflecting verbs compound with preposition, we devised a sophisticated system for carrying over irregularities from the simple verb into the compound verb, but still accounting for irregularities of the compound verb itself. See &#7973;&#956;&#945;&#953; - &#954;&#8049;&#952;&#951;&#956;&#945;&#953;, for example.</li>
 				  <li>If the user entered a preposition alone in the morphological analysis, the program hanged. This has been corrected.</li>
 				  <li>Certain verbs beginning with &#945;&#7985; such as &#945;&#7985;&#961;&#8051;&#969; made the augment wrongly. This has been corrected.</li>
 				  <li>The inflection charts for verbs compound with preposition didn't work properly. This has been corrected.</li>
 				  <li>Several extra irregular verb forms (mostly from NT) have been added.</li>
